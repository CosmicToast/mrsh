    <h1>mrsh</h1>
    <p>
      A minimal POSIX shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      mrsh provides a binary suitable as <code>/bin/sh</code> and a library
      for building new shells.
    </p>
    <h2>mrsh shell</h2>
    <p>
      The mrsh shell is strictly POSIX compliant, encouraging users to write
      portable shell scripts. Optional readline/libedit support is included to
      provide a comfortable interactive shell.
    </p>
    <h3>imrsh</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/imrsh">imrsh</a> (interactive mrsh)
      is a related project which provides a more comprehensive interactive
      shell based on mrsh.
    </p>
    <h2>libmrsh</h2>
    <p>
      libmrsh provides you the pieces necessary to build your own POSIX shell
      frontends. The standalone parser can be used to obtain a shell AST, which
      can be fed into our task runner to execute the script. It is also
      suitable for building linters, syntax highlighters, etc. The code is
      simple &amp; portable, with no external dependencies outside of POSIX
      C99.
    </p>
